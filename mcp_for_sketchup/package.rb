  # leftover partial artifact could be shipped by a release glob
  # (gh release upload mcp_for_sketchup/*.rbz). rm_f only ever targets THIS
  # build's partial output — the rm below removes only the SAME-NAMED prior
  # artifact, so a differently-named leftover (e.g. a pre-0.3.1
  # *-warehouse.rbz) survives the build and is exactly what that release glob
  # would pick up. `rm -rf mcp_for_sketchup/*.rbz` in docs/release.md §3 is
  # what clears those; this line is not a substitute for it.
